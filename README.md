# Coursera_Capstone
My attempt at the Coursera_Capstone Project for the Data Sciene Specialty.

## Introduction/Business Problem
Imagine you want to open a bar in San Francisco. Using the foursquare API I discovered which where the neighborhoods with most bars in the city.

## Data
For this project I used an open [dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/SF-Find-Neighborhoods/pty2-tcw4) of the Geographic locations and boundaries of the city of San Francisco. From that dataset I consumed a GeoJSON which allowed me to draw the shapes of each neighborhood on choroplet on top of a Folium Map. Aditionally, I used the Foursquare API in order to obtain venues and their information.
